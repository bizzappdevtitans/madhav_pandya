By changing the payload of the dictionary we can create the new users, we can search the product through its barcode and if it doesn't fetch it will
raise validation error, By clicking the "create delivery order " the delivery order will get prepared and the product which need to be searched through barcode will get pasted in move lines with the values of delivery payload
